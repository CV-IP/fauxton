Fauxton
=======

Fauxton is a software library designed to leverage computer graphics technology for computer vision applications. It provides simple interfaces to the `Blender <http://www.blender.org/>`_ animation system and the `Open Shading Language <http://www.openshading.com/>`_. Fauxton supports reading and writing Blender scenes, photorealistic rendering, and precise, automated annotation. It also provides a mechanism for serializing instances of user-defined resource types via Blender's native format.

Installation
------------
Fauxton depends on `Blender 2.71+ <http://www.blender.org/download/>`_ and `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_. `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_ is also recommended, but not necessary: if it is available, Fauxton will use it to accelerate reading HDR images generated by Blender. To install these dependencies on **Ubuntu or Debian Linux**:

.. code::

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:irie/blender
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install blender python-numpy python-opencv

To install them on **OS X**, manually install Blender, making sure to move `blender.app` into `/Applications`. The rest of the dependencies can be installed with `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_:

.. code::

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install numpy
    brew install opencv

Fauxton itself can be installed from the Python package index:

.. code::

    pip install fauxton
