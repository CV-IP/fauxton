Fauxton is a software library designed to leverage computer graphics technology for computer vision applications. It provides simple interfaces to the [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) animation system and the [Open Shading Language](http://www.openshading.com/). Fauxton supports reading and writing Blender scenes, photorealistic rendering, and precise, automated annotation. It also provides a mechanism for serializing instances of user-defined resource types via Blender's native format.

Installation
------------
Fauxton depends on [Blender 2.71+](http://www.blender.org/download/) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) is also recommended, but not necessary: if it is available, Fauxton will use it to accelerate reading HDR images generated by Blender. To install these dependencies on **Ubuntu or Debian Linux**:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:irie/blender
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install blender python-numpy python-opencv

To install them on **OS X**, manually install Blender, making sure to move `blender.app` into `/Applications`. The rest of the dependencies can be installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install numpy
    brew install opencv

Fauxton itself can be installed from the Python package index:

    pip install fauxton
